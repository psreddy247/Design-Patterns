In Singleton pattern, It involves only a single class, which is responsible to create an object.
And its make sure that only one object is instantiate. And also provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.

Implementation:


Created concrete classes:
 1. SingletonObject
 2. SingletonpatternDemo

SingletonpatternDemo, our demo class will use getInstance() method to get a SingletonObject.

ULM is added for above
